<br>ğŸ’» I am a 2023 graduate of Nanyang Polytechnic, where I obtained my diploma in Infocomm and Security.  
<br>ğŸ’µ I am a dealer for several companies, including Onexox and Eckare.
<br>ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about web development.
<br>âš¡ Fun fact: Roblox got me hooked on programming because I would create small games when I was younger.
